## Andres <br/>

- If there is something that is tough to figure out, he is willing and able to do the necessary work to suss out exactly what is wrong. 

- Working in a group/team setting on technical problems. Doing tasks truly as a team. 


## Angela<br/>
- Detail oriented through her hands on technical work in a medical lab. 

- It has been helpful in troubleshooting code so far, especially syntax errors. 

- Working in a team setting on techincal projects, specifically on coding. 

## Mario<br/>
- Works well under pressure, currently works in a high stress job, so he is used to it. Feels that there is always a solution to a problem. 

- This will be helpful during the project when it comes to crunch time. Optimistic outlook. 

- Asking for help when it is needed. Has a natural urge to tough it out. 

## Jim<br/>
- Hard working, driven to get the job done. Sometimes takes too long and doesn't realize how much time has passed. 

- Looks forward to working on the project, doesn't mind doing hard work.

- develop the technical skillset to become a more competent coder. 



## Summary<br/> 

- Meeting regularly, asking questions, "morning huddle"<br/>

- rotation of duties

- feeling free to speak up with anything, especially with regards to the project and team dynamics. 

## Conflict Plan

Conflict Resolution: dial 911 in case of emergency. For smaller events, meeting together as a team to discuss how to move forward. Disagreers handshake afterwards. <br/>

If not letting other members contribute: don't let the problem continue. Members will address their issues with other members directly if they feel comfortable, but are encouraged to discuss with other team members if they do not feel comfortable with 1 on 1 confrontation. <br/>

With respect and patience. Everyone can contribute, even if some members are more technically proficient than others. A team members value is in their value as a human being, not how many lines of code they can write. <br/>

Concerns will first be raised between members of the team, who will depending on circumstances around the lack of contribution make the decision to either speak with that member directly or raise the issue with the instructor if the non contributing member is non responsice to group criticism. 

If the member in question is unresponsive to group feedback, the group will notify the instructor. 

## Communication Plan

- What hours will you be available to communicate? M-F 6P-930P, All day saturday. Sunday if we have to, but that will be discussed in detail on saturday before end of class. 
- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)? Phone
- How often will you take breaks? 10 min every hour. 
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind? Look back to MVP, and see if there are things that can be cut back to allow for the MVP to be developed by the deadline. 
- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend? We already meet during these hours regularly. Meeting during regular working hours will not be possible due to team members work schedules. 
- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard? We are a small group, so we are hoping it shouldn't be too much of an issue. However, during meetings/discussion at regular intervals members will be asked if they have anything they would like to add or disagree with. 
- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up? By being kind and respcutful with one another, and every team member making an effort to engage with one another. 

## Work Plan

Identify Tasks: Discussed in meetings.<br/>
Assign Tasks: Tasks that are discussed in meetings will be assigned to an individual at the meeting. Tasks will be rotatated through by team members so that everyone is aware of what is going on throughout the project. <br/>
Know when they are complete: test them.
